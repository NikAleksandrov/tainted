tainted - Tool to get the current taint value and print each set bit in
	  human readable format

(C) 2014 - Nikolay Aleksandrov <nikolay@redhat.com>

Completely free, no license whatsoever.

The current taint value is extracted from /proc/sys/kernel/tainted

Example:
$ make
cc -c -Wall tainted.c -o tainted.o
cc  tainted.o -o tainted
$ ls
Makefile  README  tainted  tainted.c  tainted.o
$ ./tainted -h
./tainted [-hi]
Without command-line options this tool will print
the current taint value with information about
each set bit.
h - this help
i - print information about the different taint bits

$ ./tainted
Taint value: 12289
